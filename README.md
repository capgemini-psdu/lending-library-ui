# Lending Library application
A trivial implementation of a GOV.UK application using Spark Java.

## Dependencies
There are several different ways of building and running this application but as a minimum you will need Java 8 and internet access.

Ideally you will also have Maven or Gradle installed, although you can use the Gradle Wrapper that's bundled with the application instead if you prefer.

Whichever method you use the application will start on the port configured in the Application.java class.

## Building and running with bundled Gradle Wrapper
Use this method if you cannot install Maven or Gradle on your target machine.

Simply run the Gradle Wrapper `gradlew` script with the run command:

`gradlew run`

This will download all the application's dependencies from the internet, compile the application and start the application.

## Building and running with Maven
If you have Maven installed on your target machine then you can use that to build and then run the application:

`mvn clean package`

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Application"`

## Building and running with Gradle
If you have Gradle installed on your target machine then you can use that to build and then run the application:

`gradle build`

`gradle run`
